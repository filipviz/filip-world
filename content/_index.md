I'm Filip Vizitiu.

- I worked as a jazz trumpet player, music producer, and audio engineer from 2019-2021. I studied under Valery Ponomarev and Ingrid Jensen, and mostly played in NYC and LA â€“ [hard bop](https://youtu.be/2gIRb6bx_p8?si=B-zoTUF8aybQg96q) was my favorite.
- From 2021-2024, I worked on {{< link src="https://juicebox.money" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}Juicebox{{< /link >}}, a platform for crowdfunding and operating projects on Ethereum. We helped fund projects like [Julian Assange's legal defense](https://juicebox.money/p/assangedao) and [ConstitutionDAO](https://juicebox.money/p/constitutiondao), facilitating about $200mm in payments as a bootstrapped [DAO](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/#what-are-daos). I worked on [documentation](https://docs.juicebox.money), the governance process, [backend services](https://github.com/Bananapus/juicerkle), our Discord server, [spam detection](https://github.com/filipviz/juicehammer), the [multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0xAF28bcB48C40dBC86f52D459A6562F658fc94B1e), and the [website itself](https://juicebox.money). I spent the plurality of my time working directly with project creators.

I left Juicebox in late 2024 to study machine learning, and I'm working on independent research for now. I'm interested in Linux, calisthenics, classics, and theology. You can see some of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/filipviz), or email me: f (at) filip.world.
