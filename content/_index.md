My name is Filip.

- I worked as a jazz trumpet player, music producer, and audio engineer from 2019-2021.
- Since November 2021, I have been working on {{< link src="https://juicebox.money" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}Juicebox{{< /link >}}, a platform for running businesses and crowdfunding campaigns on Ethereum.

I'm interested in machine learning, which I study in my free time. You can see some of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/filipviz), or email me: f (at) filip.world.
