My name is Filip.

- I worked as a jazz trumpet player, music producer, and audio engineer from 2019-2021. I studied under Valery Ponomarev and Ingrid Jensen, and played in the NYC/LA areas.
- From 2021-2024, I worked on {{< link src="https://juicebox.money" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}Juicebox{{< /link >}}, a platform for funding and running projects on Ethereum. We helped fund projects like [Julian Assange's legal defense](https://juicebox.money/p/assangedao) and [ConstitutionDAO](https://juicebox.money/p/constitutiondao), facilitating more than $187mm in payments as a [DAO](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/#what-are-daos) with no institutional funding.

I'm taking a year off to study mathematics and machine learning. I'm interested in Linux, calisthenics, classics, and theology. You can see some of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/filipviz), or email me: f (at) filip.world.
